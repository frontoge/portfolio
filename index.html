      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my portfolio/website. My name is Matt Widenhouse and I am a software engineer currently based out of
            Norfolk, VA. I am currently in my final semester at Old Dominion University where I will soon graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science with a
            Minor in actuarial mathematics. I am currently employed as a Backend Engineer for the Batten College of Engineering & Technology.
            While all of my professional experience up to this point has been in web application development, I have personal project experience in graphics
            programming as well as video game modification and development. In the future I plan to continue expanding my knowledge in all of these fields
            while also expanding into machine learning, mobile application development, and embedded systems.
        </p>
